        <DescriptionProgramSrvcAccomTxt>DURING THE YEAR, THE STAPLES AREA MEN'S CHORUS (SAMC) HAD 28 MEMBERS. OUR YEAR STARTED WITH THE LITTLE RED CABOOSE VARIETY SHOW ON AUGUST 18, 2022 IN WHICH WE PERFORMED AND ASSISTED BACK STAGE, 21 MEMBERS PARTICIPATED AND THERE WERE 268 IN ATTENDANCE. ON OCTOBER 1, 2022 OUR MUSIC FESTIVAL "REAL MEN SING" TOOK ANOTHER TURN OR CHANGE, THE SAMC EXPERIMENTED WITH A NEW LOCATION/VENUE FOR OUR FESTIVAL. WE SELECTED A NEIGHBORING COMMUNITY AS A HOST SITE. THIS WAS WELL RECEIVED WITH 272 ATTENDEES AT THE FINALE CONCERT AND MAYBE CONSIDERED FOR A ROTATING VENUE FOR FUTURE FESTIVALS. IT WAS ALSO A WAY FOR THE SAMC TO EXPAND OUR BOUNDARIES AS PART OF OUR COMMUNITY OUTREACH GOALS. ANOTHER GOAL OF THE FESTIVAL IS TO HELP HIGH SCHOOL AND COLLEGE MUSIC PROGRAMS ATTRACT AND RETAIN MALE SINGERS FOR THEIR CHORAL ENSEMBLES AND TO HELP THEM REMAIN STRONG AND VIBRANT ORGANIZATIONS. REAL MEN SING AIMS TO HELP YOUNG MEN FIND THE JOY AND RICHNESS THAT SINGING BRINGS TO LIFE. AS ANOTHER OUTREACH OPPORTUNITY THE SAMC SANG AT A RETIREMENT EVENT FOR A MEMBER AND COMMUNITY LEADER. WE PARTICIPATED AS PART OF OUR OUTREACH AND VIRTUAL DELIVERY IN THE EMPTY STOCKING FUND RAISER IN DECEMBER OF 2022, WHICH INCLUDED A RADIO FEED. WE ALSO TRIED SOMETHING DIFFERENT WITH OUR ANNUAL CHRISTMAS CONCERT BY INVITING FORMER ALUMNI OF THE STAPLES HIGH SCHOOL, THE MOTLEY HIGH SCHOOL AND THE STAPLES MOTLEY HIGH SCHOOL TO COME AND PARTICIPATE IN SOME OF THE OLD TIME-HONORED PIECES OF MUSIC THAT USED TO BE PERFORMED ANNUALLY. THIS WAS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR MANY ALUMNI AND FAMILIES TO RETURN TO THEIR HIGH SCHOOL TO SHARE IN PAST TRADITIONS. THE REUNION CHRISTMAS CONCERT HAD 28 MEMBERS, 85 PERFORMERS AND 260 IN ATTENDANCE. IN CONTINUING WITH OUR OUTREACH OPPORTUNITIES, THE SAMC SANG IN A BUSINESS IN A NEIGHBORING COMMUNITY "LITTLE ROUND STILL" WITH 23 MEMBERS PARTICIPATING AND 95 IN ATTENDANCE AND AGAIN AT THE FFA STATE CONVENTION WITH 20 PARTICIPANTS AND 55 IN ATTENDANCE. IN APRIL 2023 THE CHORUS TRAVELED TO JAMESTOWN NORTH DAKOTA FOR THE "BIG SING" MALE CHORAL FESTIVAL AND ALONG THE WAY TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY TO STOP AT DETROIT LAKES HIGH SCHOOL AND SPENT TIME WORKING AND SINGING WITH THE HIGH SCHOOL CHOIR. THE BIG SING CHORAL FESTIVAL INCLUDED AN ADJUDICATION PERFORMANCE BY INDIVIDUAL CHOIRS, SEMINARS AND WORKSHOPS AND A CONCERT FEATURING A MASS CHOIR OF 189 INDIVIDUALS MADE UP OF THE 10 CHOIRS ATTENDING AND SEVERAL OF THE INDIVIDUAL CHOIRS WITH 400 IN ATTENDANCE FOR THE CONCERT. OUR SEASON ENDED ON MAY 20, 2023 WITH OUR SPRING AFTERGLOW CONCERT INCLUDING 26 MEMBERS AND SEVERAL AREA MUSICIANS PERFORMING AND PLAYING TO AN AUDIENCE OF 110 PEOPLE. WE ALSO CONTINUED TO WORK ON OUR WEBSITE AND VIRTUAL DELIVERY OPTIONS.</DescriptionProgramSrvcAccomTxt>
