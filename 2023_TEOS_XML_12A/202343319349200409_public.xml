        <DescriptionProgramSrvcAccomTxt>PART 3, LINE 28 - HOMELESS MINISTRY Christ Cares has a wide range of programs to help the homeless and poor of Chicagoland utilizing it's Program Director, two independent contractors, and over 55 regular volunteers. Every Tuesday morning and some Wednesday mornings homeless are picked up in the morning and transported to one of six area local churches or ministry sites. There the homeless have a nice safe area to relax, rest, &amp; work on the next step on ending their homeless condition, whatever that may be. Breakfast is served and there is also prayer and Bible Study. Some of the locations have cots for rest and washing machines and dryers for laundry. Normally between 8 to 15 attend. ON THURSDAYS Christ Cares along with New Life Baptist Church co sponsors the "Hope for the Homeless" Bible Study and lunch. Usually between 25 to 65 attend. The programs consists of singing Christian Songs and an in depth Bible Study. Each one there is encouraged to take a devotional sheet home to work on during the week. Then a very nice lunch is served. Approximately 1,700 meals are served annually through this program (Not including the Tuesday meals and other homeless outreaches). CHRIST CARES also helps the homeless with small specific needs they may have and also works on connecting the homeless with area resources and non profits as well as job leads etc. CHRIST CARES also provides counseling, encouragement, and a Christian Minister in a time of need. CHRIST CARES takes a group of volunteers to the Pacific Garden Mission (Large Homeless Shelter in Chicago) once a month to provide a Christian Service of special music, preaching, and prayer... There is often over 400 homeless in attendance which translates to an encouraging service to over 3,000 homeless annually. With the pan demic Christ Cares made adjustments to their homeless ministry including securing over 100 homeless aid packages filled with goods to help the emergency needs of the homeless. When the pan demic closed the emergency shelters and most of the area's homeless was moved to emergency motels and temporary housing Christ Cares delivered food and resources there on a weekly basis. Also Christ Cares started a TEXT MINISTRY to the homeless (most homeless have cell phones due to government programs). Christ Cares' Program Director would send out a daily encouraging text (to over 100 individuals) including a scrippture and prayer, in turn the homeless are able to respond with questions about homeless resources or spiritual issues.</DescriptionProgramSrvcAccomTxt>

        <DescriptionProgramSrvcAccomTxt>PART 3, LINE 29 - CHRISTIAN URBAN MINISTRY including RESOURCING, encouraging, and helping urban churches; as well as food ministry and urban youth ministry. Planting, helping, and empowering Urban Churches (URBAN MINISTRY AND RESOURCING). A primary goal of Christ Cares is to found (plant), encourage, and resource urban churches to empower them to proclaim and demonstrate the Love of God to their communities. Urban churches often face overwhelming needs in it's community but have very few resources to help. Christ Cares helps with this through a variety of ministry efforts. Christ Cares has a close relationship with many Chicagoland urban ministries including six primary churches that our Program Director encourages and helps in a variety of ways, including providing resources. Urban churches are typically faced with overwhelming needs in the community but have very limited resources of their own to help. Christ Cares shares the needs of urban communities and urban churches with suburban churches and encourages the suburban churches to donate helpful resources. Christ Cares believes urban churches also have a lot to offer suburban churches and encourages the building of two way relationships between urban and suburban churches. Often there are racial barriers between suburban and urban churches and Christ Cares promotes reconciliation. The resources donated helps empower these urban churches to be the center of love and hope in their poverty stricken communities. Examples of these resources are Christmas Toys, Back to School Supplies, food, Thanksgiving Baskets, gift cards, winter coats and hats. Christ Cares has a special relationship with New Life Baptist Church of Chicago Heights which was started by Christ Cares' Program Director. Many ministry programs are done jointly such as a monthly multicultural Bible Study and Prayer Breakfast, Homeless Ministry, basketball and Bible youth outreaches, evangelism, Biblical Counseling, food and resource room distribution. New Life Baptist Church provides Christ Cares with the use of an office, two joint storage resource rooms, a gymnasium and other rooms and Christ Cares in gratitude helps with some of New Life's expenses. The resourcing ministry not only helps urban churches but also urban youth as hundreds of needy children are blessed with School Supplies, and Christmas Toys as well as blessing families with food baskets. Christ Cares also helped New Life Church expand it weekly food ministry that serviced often over 50 families per week by securing 9 pallets of food.</DescriptionProgramSrvcAccomTxt>

        <DescriptionProgramSrvcAccomTxt>PART 3, LINE 30 OTHER PROGRAMS - OUTREACH MINISRIES - A central goal of Christ Cares is to share the GOOD NEWS OF THE GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST found in John 3:16 - For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only son, that whoever believes in Him, should not parish but have ever lasting life. This is done many ways including passing out gospel tracts with the various ministry projects and sharing the gospel at events. Christ Cares promotes evangelism training to empower Christians to share their faith. We also try to use the Internet to encourage Christians and help them grow in their faith. Christ Cares is currently exploring ways to train people to share their faith and encourage those in need through the Internet. TRANSPORTATION MINISTRY - Christ Cares maintains a fleet of vehicles to provide transportation to it's various ministry programs and also to transport resources to those in need.</DescriptionProgramSrvcAccomTxt>

      <ExplanationTxt>We apologize for filing late. We have had a series of family health emergencies which have dominated our lives (Scott Reese, Program Director and responsible for the 990). In 2020 I had Bladder Cancer and ended the year with a serious case of Covid 19. In 2021 I had a serious stroke and was in Intensive Care for 4 days. In 2022 my wife had a massive brain aneurysm : she required three weeks intensive care plus three weeks additional hospitalization and several months on outpatient therapy. In 2023 my wife is still recovering from the stroke - the biggest impact is that it has made her psychiatric conditions bipolar and extreme anxiety much worst and requires much care. I also had a second bladder cancer surgery although this did not impact things as much. Finding time and energy beyond my regular responsibilities has been challenging. We are working on getting everything up to date and better involving our team so we don't fall behind again. We would deeply appreciate understanding and grace for filing late. Thank You</ExplanationTxt>
